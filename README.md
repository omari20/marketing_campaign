# Integrated Marketing Campaign Report

## Project Overview
Idea Creative Co advertises across multiple (5) marketing channels which include:
1.	Facebook Ads
2.	Google Ads
3.	Microsoft Ads
4.	Linkedin Ads
5.	TikTok Ads

## Current State
Idea Co currently exports data from each platform as CSV files and then import them into Excel to manually create reports.
It is becoming increasingly challenging to understand the impact of our marketing efforts due to data being siloed in different places.






This repo shows the objectives and steps taken to create an integrated report that shows ad campaigns pulled from different sources.
